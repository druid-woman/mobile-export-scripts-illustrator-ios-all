# mobile-export-scripts-illustrator-ios-all
Export iOS app icons from Illustrator. Based off Austyn Mahoney's script. This includes additional sizes for iOS icons, and removes the Artboard name, names are automatically created as part of the script to match Apple's icon specs.

Original script from Austyn Mahoney:

Work to be done :)
The changes I made focused mainly on the Apple iOS icons since their icon specifications are more clear.
More work needs done for the Android icon naming, but the basics are still here from original author.
